<h2>About Us</h2>
<p></p><h3>Welcome to Paw lovers Rescue!</h3><br>

Paw lovers Rescue, Inc. is an independent, 501(c)(3)/non-profit, foster-based rescue group founded upon the core belief that all dogs are created equal. Based in Brooklyn, Paw lovers Rescue was created by Amy Marciano, an ardent Pit Bull/Staffordshire Terrier supporter and total animal admirer.<br>
 Our dogs are rescued directly from high-kill shelters, whether it be Animal Care &amp; Control here in New York or various shelters down south, where thousands are euthanized every year due to lack of resources and lack of space. Although we have a particular soft spot for the dogs that are most discriminated against, we rescue all different breeds of all different ages. The majority of them are saved just in the nick of time, <b>so choosing to adopt undoubtedly saves lives!</b><br>

Paw lovers consists of many compassionate volunteer foster parents who help make saving lives possible, one pooch at a time. We advocate against back-yard breeders, puppy mills, and the selling of animals for profit. We support education and understanding of all dog breeds and encourage people to try and see beyond the media-sanctioned stereotypes and ignorance that exists. Dogs are amazing, intelligent, and affectionate creatures who could teach us humans a great deal.

We are always accepting applications from potential adopters and looking for new volunteers to foster our loveable pooches. The key to a successful adoption is simply finding the right canine-human match. For many people, the experience of going to a shelter to adopt can be a bit overwhelming. By actually living with our rescue dogs, our fosters are able to provide valuable feedback which enables us to know as much as possible about our canine companions before they go to a new home. We also provide adopters with helpful information like food and toy recommendations, vet and trainer referrals, tips on preventative care, and useful reading on dog behavior and training.

Our adoption fee for any dog is $300 and all our Paw lovers will be spayed/neutered, vaccinated (Distemper/Parvo, Bordetella, Rabies), heartworm tested, and microchipped prior to adoption. If we do not currently have the right match for you, you are welcome to e-mail us about what your ideal dog would be like. We will try and find you your canine match and contact you when we rescue a potential candidate!<br>

<h3>About Amy Marciano, Founder of Paw lovers Rescue</h3>
<p>Having always been completely crazy about animals, I have worked in the animal welfare field in various capacities throughout the course of the last decade. I've worked in the private no-kill sector, the public high-kill sector, in veterinary care, dog walking, doggie daycare, training, and even as a pet portrait photographer. Amidst all those valuable experiences, my unwavering desire to be focusing solely on rescue was always apparent.

Animals have been my passion ever since I was on all fours myself. Dogs in particular have an incredible ability to make us inadequate humans feel needed, loved, and so special (a gift we really don't deserve considering the direction we've taken this planet and it's non-human creatures). I figure the absolute least we can do in return is treat these wonderful beasts of the canine persuasion with kindness and respect. The overpopulation problem is, after all, our fault-- not theirs. We are the reason why 8 to 12 million companion animals end up in U.S. shelters every year with 60% of them being euthanized. We domesticated them, bred them for our various uses, and didn't bother to spay and neuter as a standard practice. Human greed and our desire for instant gratification has led to shelters bursting at the seams with no alternatives. "No kill" organizations simply turn animals away, making them someone else's problem, knowing full well that the "someone else" is most likely a kill shelter. So, what's the solution? I honestly don't believe there is a truly fair solution where no animals will suffer. I do believe however, with all of my heart, that an individual can make a difference and that difference can be measured by a wagging tail. Long or stubby, straight or curly, soft or bristly... to them, it makes all the difference in the world.

So, with that belief, Paw lovers Rescue was born. With the staggering number of dogs in need and knowing that there is nothing else that I'd rather dedicate my life's work to, there was just no reason not to start my own rescue. Paw lovers was affectionately named after my own much-adored rescue mutt, Gandalf (the handsome little guy to the right). At only two months old, he had ended up at the AC&amp;C as a stray. He quickly wiggled his way into my heart and naturally acquired the irresistable nickname "sugar mutt."
