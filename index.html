<h1>Welcome to Paw Lovers, inc.!</h1>
<p class="section1">Paw lovers Rescue is a non-profit, 501(c)(3), public charity dog rescue and adoption service based in Queens, New York. We rescue adoptable dogs from the city shelters, so most of our pooches are veterans of doggie death row. Some ended up there as strays, some were given up for reasons having nothing to do with them... but all are full of love and now looking for a new start. We specialize in matching the right dog with the right person or family and we do our best to help you every step of the way.

If you are looking to adopt and don't see the right canine companion on our site, please don't hesitate to contact us with a bit about what you're looking for in a dog. There is never a shortage of loveable dogs needing homes and we'd be happy to keep an eye out for the right one for you. You may also want to talk to us about the option of fostering-to-adopt. Fostering is a terrific way to help a dog in need while also helping yourself find the right match.
